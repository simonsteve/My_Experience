My_Experience and Journey as a Data Scientist

Hello Everyone. Below you will find outline of the recent projects i have participated in as a Data Scientist.
    

My Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio are as folllows:

    Here are Links to my favorite Data Science projects using real-world data and problems/ scenerio;
